The Hangman game is a classic word-guessing game built with Tkinter in Python. It picks a random word from a list provided by the user. Players guess one letter at a time to reveal the hidden word. With a limited number of attempts, they aim to correctly guess the word. The GUI offers an easy-to-use interface for inputting guesses and managing the game. Incorrect guesses are flagged, and the word's progress is displayed. The game concludes when the word is guessed correctly or when attempts are exhausted, showing the outcome. Players can start afresh by resetting the game with a new word list.
